        <p class="mb-4">We believe good food doesn’t have to be complicated or expensive. We believe you can create meals that you’re proud of, meals that make you feel full and healthy, meals that make you want to brag on social media, meals that will make you want your leftovers (no, really). We believe you can have all of this without spending your whole paycheck, buying a bunch of fancy kitchenware, or spending all day in the kitchen. We believe you can spend less and enjoy more.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Foodster was born in 2015 when founder, Elena Gilbert, was drowning in student loan debt and trying to make ends meet on a meager hourly wage. She began calculating down to the penny everything she was spending on food. After a few quick calculations, Elena started noticing some patterns… Some ingredients were budget busters and some were budget savers! So she started to strategically craft recipes, tweaking the ratios of budget-savers and budget-busters, always making sure to use simple ingredients that would also leave her satisfied. Being the nerdy number cruncher she is, Elena couldn’t wait to share the recipes with the world.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Since the launch of foodster.com, Foodster has been teaching people all around the world how to cook with their simple recipes and step-by-step photo instructions. We now have a team of recipe creators, social media masters, and techy number crunchers to keep the budget recipes flowing! You can find our print book at your nearest book store, our mobile app in the App store, or come visit us on every major social media platform. We hope you stick around, explore our extensive recipe archives, and whip up something delicious!</p>
